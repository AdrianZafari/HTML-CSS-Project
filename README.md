__25/09/2024: Notes and Reflections__

Given that the project did not call on us to use Javascript, the things I have added were more out of curiosity and a desire to make a website that feels functional insofar as what I can intuit from the figma document. Some changes have been made where it felt appropriate such as in the FAQ section with "Still have unanswered questions..." needing to be underneath the FAQ accordion for the tablet and mobile designs to flow more logically with the section layout. 

The resolution of some images aught to be changed so as to ensure that the transitions happen more seamlessly. This is primarily the case for the dropdown chevrons when changing from light to dark mode. This same issue exists in a greater capacity for the toggle image switch in the accordion of the FAQ section. I assume that the resolution of the source images needs to be looked at in order to resolve this.
